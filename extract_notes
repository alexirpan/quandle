A wordle clue has 3 parts of info

1. Position in word
2. Letter
3. Color

Uhhh but then letter repeats make it hard...
Well maybe not.

Assume extract is all greens.

Then a given (position, letter) combo can appear at most once.
i.e. in column x, letter k has count 1 and all other letters have count 2
but if you do this, then you can only extract at most 5 letters
Okay that's not good.

How about (present, letter) clues?
to be unique, that letter cannot appear in any other word in the word list
that seems worse.

How about absent clue?
To be unique, every other word has to include that letter.
Okay, picking 1 clue seems bad then.

How about assuming 2 greens for selection?
There are 5 choose 2 = 10 possible pairs of indices to pick

So picking 1 pair in a word means distributing 9 pairs among the remaining words...

10N pairs total and 90% are shared? Seems pretty constrained.

corollary - if it's hard to make only one square give a unique clue, then most words should have
a 1-eye or 2-eye solution

Probably 1-eye is enough and 2-eye makes it less grindy?
